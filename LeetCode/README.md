# Welcome to LeetCodeFiles
This repository is going to act as a storage place for me to keep track of all of my daily leetcode problems. In here there are also a couple of different folders and files I may add in that I use to keep track of all of these files, and automate the creation of the folders. This is mostly done in PowerShell...

Starting doing LeetCode because I was preparing for internship/job interviews but never organized everything so one of my New Years resolutions for 2025 is to properly document and store my code so that I can easily find it, and in the future others may as well. (Not that anybody is interested in seeing my daily struggle on LeetCode, but maybe for my own reference.)

I'd like to eventually start making videos talking about how I solve the problems but right now my schedule is not very allowing of that so I will just continue to develop my skills until then. If you are reading this and considering committing to doing LeetCode I highly recommend it! It changes the way you view certain tasks and problems. Best Wishes, Drew...
